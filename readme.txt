Developer plugin for those working off local server wordpress copies. Adds "local |" to your title if wordpress is running off a local server.

== Description ==

This plugin is made for developers who work on local server copies of live wordpress installations, and want to know for sure if they're working on their local copy, not the live one!

Working on a local copy of wordpress which runs of a local server is quite convenient. Major advantages include faster loading times and the ability to quickly and easily make changes mitigating the risk of bringing down a live site.

Plugin is compatible with Wordpress, Wordpress MU (WPMU) , and BuddyPress.

If you have any problems with the plugins, please visit our [http://netweblogic.com/forums/](support forums) for further information and provide some feedback first, we may be able to help. It's considered rude to just give low ratings and nothing reason for doing so.

== Notes ==

Some themes may not change if the title tag doesn't use the wp_title or bloginfo functions.

The plugin assumes your local server IP address is 127.0.0.1 . If different you can change the value in the plugin file.
